# Password-Generator
Passwords are a means by which a user proves that they are authorized to use a device.
It is important that passwords must be long and complex.
This repository contains a Python-based password generator that creates secure , random and memorable passwords. The tool applies mathematical operations to each character of the input password while preserving special characters, resulting in a unique and jumbled output."

# Features:
- User Customization: "Users can enter any password they choose and select three operations from a predefined list, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. This customization allows users to incorporate their preferences into the password generation process."
- Rotating Operations: "The selected operations are applied in a rotating manner to each character, adding complexity and making the generated password less predictable."
- Skip Value: "Users can choose a skip value between 1 and 15, further altering the transformations applied to their password, enhancing uniqueness."

# Security Benefits:
- Complexity and Unpredictability: "By applying different operations to each character, the password becomes more complex and less susceptible to common attack methods, such as brute force or dictionary attacks. The transformation process makes it difficult for an attacker to guess the original password, even if they are aware of the operations used."
  
# User-Friendliness:
- Simplicity of Use: "The tool is easy to use, as users can simply input their desired password and select from a clear list of operations. This makes it accessible even for those who may not be tech-savvy."
- Memorability: "Since users can incorporate familiar elements into their passwords and select operations that they understand, the generated passwords are easier to remember, which is often a challenge with complex passwords."
