# Password-Generator
Passwords are a means by which a user proves that they are authorized to use a device.
It is important that passwords must be long and complex.
This repository contains a Python-based password generator that creates secure, random passwords base on the user input.

# Features:
- User Input: The user provides a string of characters to include in the password.
- Jumbling: The program jumbles the input to generate a password that appears random.
- Memory-Friendly: The generated password retains elements from the userâ€™s input, making it easier to remember while still looking random and secure.

# Security Benefits
This approach enhances security by generating passwords that are difficult to guess or crack, thus protecting against unauthorized access.
